The underground is exclusive.

It's like a private golf course membership with a $50,000 initiation fee. It's like a masonry based secret society with a 14 step handshake. It's like that wild animal lodge that sells sandwiches that smell like feet, ice cold Lowenbrau for $1.75, and the little pull tab lotto tickets. It's like a high brow group of intellectuals that requires it's members to score 150 or above on a test that doesn't really determine how smart you are.

This group is limited to only those with a thirst for Ruby knowledge and 30 free minutes a month to talk about it. That's exclusivity, Holmes.
